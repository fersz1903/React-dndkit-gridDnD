## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

### DnD App

You can drag a draggable item and drop to the droppable area. That makes a copy of the draggable item with a unique id.

If you drop an item out of the droppable area, this item deleted from the droppable area.

You can also switch the draggables.

This project first step of the creating user interface with dnd.
